Arrays allow you to hold many different values.

For instance: If you have 40 grades under variables grade1, grade2, grade3... you could create an array called "grades" which holds all of them

Array index's begin at 0.

The first item in the index is 0, and the last item is n(number of items in array) - 1

To create:
<data type> name[size];


Create an array of integers called "grades"
int grades[10];
^ This is an uninitialized array, its a list full of garbage random values.

to access a place inside of an array, you reference it with
grades[2] (accesses the third grade)




-arrays can only hold one type of data type.

-The items in an array are all held next to eachother in the memory
