remember:

fgets(str,size-1,sddin); <--Gets input and creates a string

str[strlen(str) - 1] = '\0';

--Remember that scanf doesnt work if its more than one word.

could also do a getchar manual version of getting a string

    while (i < SIZE - 1 && c != '\n'){
        str[i] = c;
        i++;
        c = getchar();
    }
    str[i] = '\0';



    Note: strcpy(char *s1, const char *s2);  Copies s2 into s1

    the function strcat appends its second argument ( a string) to its first argument (a character array containing a string)
    -The first character of the second argument replaces the null ('\0') that terminates the string in the first arrgument
         --You must ensure that the array used to store the firsy string is large enough to hold it and the second string.


strcmp [string compare]

strcmp(s1, s2)   [s1 and s2 are strings]
returns 0 if they are the same,
>0 if s1 is first in the dictionary
<0 if s1 is second in the dictionary

Multidinmensional Arrays 
    *Multidimensional arrays can represent tables of values consisting of information arranged in rows and columns
    *To identify a particular table element, we must specify two indices:
        -The first(by convention) identifies the element's rows

    In two dimensional arrays there are rows and columns

    int a[5][10]  Creates array with 5 rows, 10 columns


    You can initialize a two dimensional array like this:

    int b[2][2] = {{1,2}, {3,4}}   which looks like    12
                                                       34
